kalloc() :

walkpgdir() : finds PTE for virtual address
mappages() : creates/installs PTE for new mappings

// This table defines the kernel's mappings, which are present in
// every process's page table.
pushcli():
// Pushcli/popcli are like cli/sti except that they are matched:
// it takes two popcli to undo two pushcli.  Also, if interrupts
// are off, then pushcli, popcli leaves them off.
